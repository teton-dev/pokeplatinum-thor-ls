// Widescreen (experimental: Settings > Display > Widescreen, libntr's setting).
// While the field map is shown, libntr draws the 3D scene as wide as the top display and the
// field camera's projection is widened to match, so more of the map shows on the sides. The
// 2D layers (text boxes, menus, the location banner) stay 4:3 in the middle, except the
// weather's: its sprites (rain, snow, sand, ash) repeat across the sides, the 4:3 picture
// wrapping around (not while the start menu's sprite icons are up), and its BG2 picture (fog,
// sand, clouds, the forests' light) is drawn across the whole width from its tilemap. Flash's
// darkness (a circle of windows drawn line by line) stays 4:3, as do menus and other screens
// off the field map.
//
// Battles in Black 2 and White 2's engine (Gen 5 battles) go wide too: their arena is 3D and
// their camera is widened the same way (Gen5_SetWidescreen). Platinum's own battles stay 4:3
// (black bars at the sides): their backdrop is a 256-pixel picture and the bases and HP boxes
// are placed for 256 pixels, so there's nothing real to show at the sides.
